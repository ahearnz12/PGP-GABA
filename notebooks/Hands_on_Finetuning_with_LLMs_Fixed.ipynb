        "**BERTScore** is a metric for evaluating text generation tasks, including summarization, translation, and captioning. Unlike traditional metrics like ROUGE or BLEU that rely on exact word overlaps, BERTScore uses embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model to measure **semantic similarity** between the generated text (predictions) and the human-written text (references). This makes it more robust in capturing meaning, even when different words are used.\n",

        "* **Precision** - Measures how much of the content in the generated text is actually relevant to the reference. High precision means the model is not adding irrelevant or "extra" information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Recall** - Measures how much of the important content from the reference is captured by the generated text. A high recall means the model covers most of the key points, even if it includes some extra details.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **F1 Score** - Combines both precision and recall into a balanced score. It demonstrates how well the generated text both covers the important content and remains relevant. This is usually reported as the main metric for BERTScore.\n",
