    "\n",
    "1. `tokenizer.apply_chat_template()`: This method converts the `messages` list into a single formatted string (e.g., adding special tokens or chat-style formatting), and tokenizes it into a tensor using PyTorch (`return_tensors=\"pt\"`). The `.to(model.device)` part ensures the tokenized input is moved to the same device as the model (like a GPU or CPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `pad_token_id`: This variable is assigned the padding token ID used by the tokenizer. If the tokenizer does not explicitly define a `pad_token_id`, it falls back to the `eos_token_id` (end-of-sequence token). This is needed to handle padding properly during attention and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `attention_mask:` This creates a mask that tells the model which tokens should be attended to (represented by 1) and which should be ignored (usually padding tokens, represented by 0). It ensures the model focuses only on valid input tokens during processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `generate()` function defined above, the following arguments are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `max_new_tokens`: This parameter determines the maximum length of the generated sequence. In the provided code, max_new_tokens is set to 100, which means the generated sequence should not exceed 100 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `temperature`: The temperature parameter controls the level of randomness in the generation process. A higher temperature (e.g., closer to 1) makes the output more diverse and creative but potentially less focused, while a lower temperature (e.g., close to 0) produces more deterministic and focused but potentially repetitive outputs. In the code, temperature is set to 0.7, indicating a very low temperature and, consequently, a more deterministic sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `do_sample`: This is a boolean parameter that determines whether to use sampling during generation (do_sample=True) or use greedy decoding (do_sample=False). When set to True, as in the provided code, the model samples from the distribution of predicted tokens at each step, introducing randomness in the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `top_p`: Controls how many top probable tokens to consider during generation. If set to 0.9, it samples from the smallest set of tokens whose combined probability is at least 90%, balancing creativity and coherence.\n"
