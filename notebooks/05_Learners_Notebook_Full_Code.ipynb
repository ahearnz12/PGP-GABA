Therefore, based on the supplied information, medical therapy alone is **not considered curative** for acute appendicitis. |\n",
      "| **Surgical procedure recommended** | • Appendectomy (removal of the vermiform appendix). <br>• Pre‑operative preparation: insertion of a nasogastric tube (NGT), monitoring urine output with catheter if volume depletion is suspected, and maintaining fluid/electrolyte balance with IV fluids. <br>• Prophylactic antibiotics covering intestinal flora are given pre‑operatively (e.g., cefotetan 1–2 g bid or amikacin 5 mg/kg tid plus clindamycin 600–900 mg qid). |\n",
      "| **Special considerations** | • If an abscess or inflammatory mass has formed, the procedure may be limited to drainage of the abscess rather than immediate appendectomy. <br>• The risk of complications (necrosis, gangrene, perforation) increases rapidly with delayed treatment; therefore prompt surgical intervention is essential. |\n",

      "\n",
      "| Section | Content |\n",
      "|---------|---------|\n",
      "| **1. Definition & Clinical Presentation** | Sudden, well‑demarcated bald patches on the scalp are most commonly due to *alopecia areata* (non‑scarring) or a *scarring alopecia* such as lichen planopilaris or lupus erythematosus. The border of the patch is usually sharp and may be accompanied by mild itching or tenderness. |\n",
      "| **2. Possible Causes** | 1. **Alopecia areata** – an autoimmune attack on hair follicles that causes sudden, patchy loss without follicular destruction.<br>2. **Scarring alopecias** – inflammatory conditions (e.g., lichen planopilaris, lupus erythematosus) where the follicle is destroyed and permanent loss occurs.<br>3. **Traction alopecia** – mechanical pulling from hairstyles; usually presents with a pattern of loss along the hairline or in areas of tension.<br>4. **Infections** (tinea capitis, bacterial infections) – may present as patchy loss if inflammation destroys follicles.<br>5. **Drug‑induced** – certain medications can precipitate diffuse or patchy shedding. |\n",
      "| **3. Diagnostic Work‑up** | - **Clinical exam**: look for sharp borders, erythema, scaling.<br>- **Pull test**: negative in alopecia areata; may be positive if inflammation is present.<br>- **Daily hair counts** (patient collects shed hairs for 14 days): >100/day abnormal unless after shampooing.<br>- **Fungal/bacterial cultures** and **immunofluorescence studies** to rule out infectious or autoimmune scarring alopecias.<br>- **Skin biopsy** if diagnosis remains uncertain. |\n",
      "| **4. Evidence‑Based Treatment Options** | **Alopecia areata (non‑scarring)**<br>• *Topical corticosteroids* – first‑line for mild disease.<br>• *Intralesional corticosteroids* – effective for small patches; administer 0.5–1 mL of triamcinolone acetonide (10–40 mg/mL) into the lesion every 4–6 weeks.<br>• *Systemic corticosteroids* – reserved for extensive or severe disease.<br>• *Topical minoxidil* (2% for women, 2–5% for men) – prolongs anagen phase; apply 1 mL twice daily to the affected area.<br>• *Topical anthralin*, *topical immunotherapy* (diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutylester), and *PUVA* are options for refractory cases.<br><br>**Scarring alopecias**<br>• Treat underlying inflammation: systemic corticosteroids, antimalarials, or other disease‑specific agents depending on the diagnosis (e.g., hydroxychloroquine for lupus erythematosus).<br>• Once follicles are destroyed, permanent loss occurs; no reversal is possible.<br><br>**Traction alopecia**<br>• Eliminate mechanical traction: change hairstyles, avoid tight braids or ponytails.<br>• Supportive care with gentle cleansing and moisturization.<br><br>**Infections**<br>• *Tinea capitis*: topical or oral antifungals (e.g., terbinafine 250 mg daily for 4–6 weeks).<br>• Bacterial infections: appropriate antibiotics based on culture results.\n",
