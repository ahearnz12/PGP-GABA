    "# FoodHub Chatbot - FullCode Implementation (GPT-OSS 20B with LangGraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version**: FullCode with Modern Agentic AI Features  \n",
    "**Base Model**: GPT-OSS 20B (Local LM Studio Model)  \n",
    "**Framework**: LangGraph + LangChain + Pydantic\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's in FullCode Version\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Core Enhancements**\n",
    "1. **LangGraph State Machine** - Modern graph-based agent architecture with cyclical workflows\n",
    "2. **Conversation Memory** - Persistent multi-turn conversations with SQLite checkpointing\n",
    "3. **Quality Evaluation** - LLM judges measure groundedness & precision (auto-retry if < 0.75)\n",
    "4. **Structured Logging** - Full observability for debugging and monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐ **Advanced Features**\n",
    "5. **Enhanced Guardrails** - Sentiment analysis + urgency scoring (not just intent)\n",
    "6. **Interactive Chat UI** - Multi-turn conversation interface with statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Key Improvements**\n",
    "- **Stateful**: Remembers conversation context (\"it\", \"that order\" work correctly)\n",
    "- **Quality Gates**: Automatically regenerates low-quality responses (up to 3 attempts)\n",
    "- **Better Escalation**: Detects frustration/urgency, not just intent\n",
    "- **Production-Ready**: Logging, retry logic, type safety with Pydantic\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. **Install LM Studio**: Download from https://lmstudio.ai/\n",
    "2. **Load GPT-OSS 20B Model**: In LM Studio, download and load the GPT-OSS 20B model  \n",
    "3. **Start Local Server**: In LM Studio, start the local server (usually `http://localhost:1234`)\n",
    "4. **Verify Connection**: Test connection cell will validate setup\n",

    "The number of online food delivery orders is increasing rapidly in cities, driven by students, working professionals, and families with busy schedules. Customers frequently raise queries about their orders, such as delivery time, order status, payment details, or return/replacement policies. Currently, most of these queries are managed manually by customer support teams, which often results in long wait times, inconsistent responses, and higher operational costs.\n",

Since the app already maintains structured order information in its database, there is a strong opportunity to leverage this data through intelligent systems that can directly interact with customers in real time."
