    "An enterprise sales representative at a global insurance provider is preparing for a crucial renewal meeting with one of the largest clients.

However, this valuable context is fragmented across the inbox, CRM records, and call notes.\n",

    "- By fine-tuning a language model on task-relevant and insurance-specific communication data, we significantly improved the model's ability to generate concise, actionable, and context-aware summaries.\n",
    "- The fine-tuned model now produces outputs that are not only more relevant and structured but also tailored to user expectations, enhancing sales productivity and ensuring better client engagement in the insurance domain.\n",

It uses standard transformers and PEFT without quantization, making it suitable for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) devices."
