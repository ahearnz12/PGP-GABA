        "In today's complex healthcare ecosystem, audit teams are tasked with reviewing vast amounts of claims, patient encounters, and denial records. Performing these audits manually through traditional SQL queries is time-consuming as it requires help from the specialized technical teams, and often leads to delays in identifying compliance gaps, and operational inefficiencies. Audit professionals, while domain experts, are frequently hindered by their reliance on data teams or IT specialists to retrieve the insights they need.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this challenge,**ClaimAudit AI** is building an AI-powered audit assistant that leverages Agentic AI to help audit teams query claims databases in plain language. The system dynamically translates natural queries into secure SQL execution, incorporates context from past queries for continuity, and applies guardrails against harmful or destructive inputs. By providing accurate, explainable, and real-time audit insights, the solution empowers audit professionals to focus on investigation and decision-making rather than technical data retrieval, ultimately improving efficiency."
